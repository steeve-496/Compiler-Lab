FIND OUT TOTAL NUMBER OF VOWELS AND CONSONANTS
FROM THE GIVEN INPUT STRING.


AIM:
Write a Lex program to find out total number of vowels and consonants from the given
input string.


ALGORITHM:
Step 1. Start
Step 2. Take the string as input
Step 3. Take each character from this string to check
Step 4. If this character is a vowel, increment the count of vowels
Step 5. Else increment the count of consonants.
Step 6. Print the total count of vowels and consonants in the end.
Step 7. Stop


PROGRAM:

%{
int vcount=0;
int ccount =0;
%}
%%
[aeiouAEIOU] {vcount++;}
[a-zA-Z] {ccount++;}
%%
void main()
{
printf("Enter the string of vowels and consonents:");
yylex();
printf("Number of vowels are: %d\n", vcount);
printf("Number of consonants are: %d\n", ccount);
}
int yywrap()
{
return 1;
}



OUTPUT:
Enter the string of vowels and consonents:Hello everyone
^Z
Number of vowels are: 6
Number of consonants are: 7


RESULT:
Lex program to find out total number of vowels and consonants from the given input string is
implemented.
